sigar - System Info Gather And Reporter

The Sigar api provides a portable interface for gathering system
information such as:

- system memory, swap, cpu, load average, uptime

- per-process memory, cpu, credential info, state, arguments, environment,
  open files

- file system detection and metrics

- network interface configuration info and metrics

The core API is implemented in pure C with bindings currently
implemented for Java, Perl and C#.

The following platforms are currently supported:

- Linux (2.2, 2.4, 2.6 kernels)

- Win32 (NT 4.0 sp6, 2000 Pro/Server, 2003 Server, XP)

- Solaris (2.6, 7, 8, 9)

- Solaris x86 (8, 9)

- HP/UX (11)

- AIX (4.3, 5.1, 5.2)

To test drive run the following command:

% java -jar sigar-bin/lib/sigar.jar
sigar> help

The shell and commands are implemented in Java, the source code is
located in examples/java.

Javadocs are located in docs/javadoc.

Note that this is a BETA release of Sigar.  Hyperic HQ uses Sigar in
production, however not all of the Sigar functionality is currently
used by HQ.

Perl and C# interfaces are still a work in progress.

To try the Perl examples:
% cd bindings/perl
% perl Makefile.PL && make
% perl -Mblib ../../examples/perl/ifconfig.pl
